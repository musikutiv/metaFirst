# metaFirst Ingest Helper Configuration
# Copy this file to config.yaml and customize for your setup

# Server API connection

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Lab binding (v0.4+)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Each ingestor instance is bound to exactly ONE lab.
# Projects from other labs will be rejected.
#
# - If lab_id is specified, use that lab.
# - If omitted AND exactly one lab exists, auto-bind to it.
# - If omitted AND multiple labs exist, fail with error listing them.
#
# To run ingestors for multiple labs, create separate config files:
#   python metafirst_ingest.py config_lab_a.yaml  # terminal 1
#   python metafirst_ingest.py config_lab_b.yaml  # terminal 2

# lab_id: 1  # Uncomment and set if multiple labs exist
# Note: supervisor_id still works but is deprecated

# UI settings (for browser-based metadata entry)
ui_url: http://localhost:5173  # URL of the metaFirst UI
open_browser: true             # Auto-open browser when file detected

# Ingest settings
compute_hash: false   # Whether to compute SHA256 hash for each file

# Watched folders
# Each watcher maps a local folder to a project and storage root.
#
# You can specify projects/storage roots by:
#   - Numeric ID: project_id / storage_root_id (classic, always works)
#   - Name: project_name / storage_root_name (resolved at startup)
#
# If both ID and name are provided, the numeric ID takes precedence.
# Names are resolved via the server API at startup.

watchers:
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Example 1: Using numeric IDs (classic approach)
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Use this when you know the exact IDs and they won't change.
  - watch_path: /Users/yourusername/data/qpcr
    project_id: 1
    storage_root_id: 1
    # Optional: base path for computing relative paths (default: watch_path)
    base_path_for_relative: /Users/yourusername/data
    # Optional: regex pattern to extract sample identifier from filename
    # First capturing group is used as sample identifier
    sample_identifier_pattern: "^([A-Z]+-\\d+)"

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Example 2: Using names (recommended for portability)
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Use this when you want config that survives database reseeds.
  # Names are resolved to IDs at startup via the server API.
  # - watch_path: /Users/yourusername/data/rnaseq
  #   project_name: "RNA-seq Demo Project"
  #   storage_root_name: "LOCAL_DATA"
  #   sample_identifier_pattern: "^(RNA-\\d+)"

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Example 3: Mixed approach
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # You can mix ID and name within the same watcher.
  # - watch_path: /Users/yourusername/data/microscopy
  #   project_name: "Microscopy Project"  # Resolved by name
  #   storage_root_id: 5                   # Known numeric ID

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Troubleshooting name resolution
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If a watcher fails to resolve:
#   1. Check that you have access to the project (are you a member?)
#   2. Verify the exact name (case-sensitive) via the API:
#      curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/projects
#   3. For storage roots, list them for a specific project:
#      curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/projects/1/storage-roots
#
# The helper will log skipped watchers with reasons at startup.
