## Objective

Move from "clear and usable" to operationally mature. Focus on day-2 lab operations, governance transparency, and auditability. Prioritise small, incremental UX/workflow changes; avoid new core data models or automatic enforcement.

| C — Governance transparency | Inline authority hints, role lineage copy, decision receipts | [#7](https://github.com/bmc-CompBio/metaFirst/pull/7) |
| D — Compliance posture | Remediation history, severity text, posture report | — |
| E — Multi-sample ingestion MVP | Single file → many samples via guided loop or spreadsheet import | [#5](https://github.com/bmc-CompBio/metaFirst/pull/5) |
