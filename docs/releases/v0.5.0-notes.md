# metaFirst v0.5.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** February 2026

## Overview

Version 0.5.0 focuses on **auditability and governance clarity**. This release adds foundational audit logging, bulk sample import capabilities, lab-level status aggregation, and improved UI guidance for role-based permissions.

## Highlights

### Lab Activity Log (Auditability MVP)

A database-backed audit trail captures governance-sensitive actions within labs. This provides the foundation for compliance reporting and activity review.

- Captures RDMP lifecycle changes (draft, activate, supersede)
- Logs sample creation, updates, and deletions
- Records membership changes and role assignments
- PI/Steward-accessible via API

### RDMP-derived Multi-sample Ingestion Template

Bulk sample import via CSV, with templates dynamically generated from the active RDMP.

- Download CSV template matching current RDMP field definitions
- Preview import before committing
- Validation against RDMP constraints (required fields, types)
- Append-only contract: existing CSVs remain valid when RDMPs add optional fields

### Lab Status Aggregation API

A new API endpoint aggregates lab-wide status with "needs attention" conditions.

- `GET /supervisors/{id}/status-summary` returns aggregated metrics
- Surfaces actionable issues: projects without active RDMPs, unresolved high-severity remediation tasks
- Designed for dashboard integration and oversight workflows

### Governance Clarity UX

Frontend improvements help users understand role requirements and take action.

- **Authority hints**: Inline indicators show which role is required for actions
- **Denied-state messaging**: Clear feedback when permissions are insufficient
- **Needs Attention panel**: Aggregated issues with deep links to relevant pages
- **Role request guidance**: Links to member management for role change requests

## Upgrade Notes

- **Database migration**: Run `alembic upgrade head` to apply new audit log tables
- **No breaking API changes**: All existing endpoints remain compatible
- **Template derivation**: Old CSV templates remain valid; new required RDMP fields require regenerating templates

## Known Limitations

- Audit log UI is not yet implemented (API-only in this release)
- Lab status aggregation is frozen for v0.5; additional conditions planned for v0.6
- Needs Attention panel shows first 3 affected entities per condition
