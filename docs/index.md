# metaFirst

## What is this?

metaFirst is a lightweight system for keeping track of your samples and
the metadata that goes with them. Think of it as the shared lab notebook
for *what you collected, when, and under which conditions* — without
moving any of your actual data files.

## Why bother?

- **Find things later.** Six months from now you (or a colleague) can
  search for "all pH-stress samples from the March run" instead of
  scrolling through folder names.
- **Capture metadata while it's fresh.** A small browser form pops up
  when new data lands in a watched folder — fill it in on the spot,
  before the details fade.
- **Your files stay where they are.** Nothing is uploaded or
  reorganised. The system records *references* to files, not copies.
- **One place for the whole group.** Everyone in the lab sees the same
  sample list and the same metadata fields, so handovers and
  collaborations just work.

## What it does *not* do

- It does not move, copy, or lock your data files.
- It does not enforce workflows or gate your next experiment.
- It does not require IT support to run — a single laptop is enough to
  get started.

## How to use it (the short version)

1. **Log in** via the web interface your lab lead will share with you
   (a local URL, typically on the lab network).
2. **Pick your project** from the sidebar.
3. **Add samples** — either create them by hand or let the file watcher
   suggest new ones when data appears in a watched folder.
4. **Fill in the metadata** the form asks for. The fields are defined by
   your project's data management plan, so you'll see only what's
   relevant.
5. **Search and browse** whenever you need to find a sample or check
   what was recorded.

That's it. If someone in your group needs to set up metaFirst from
scratch, there is a [step-by-step install guide](install).
